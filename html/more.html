        <h2> Hiking </h2>
        <p>hiking, walking in nature as a recreational activity. Especially among those with sedentary occupations,
            hiking is a natural exercise that promotes physical fitness, is economical and convenient, and requires no
            special equipment. Because hikers can walk as far as they want, there is no physical strain unless they walk
            among hills or mountains.

            Many persons walk alone, mainly on weekends or holidays, but youth clubs and other groups arrange rambles,
            or hikes. The normal length of the walk undertaken is 7 to 12 miles (11 to 19 km) for a half day or 12 to 20
            miles (19 to 32 km) for a full day. Those organized rambles, combining exercise with enjoyment of the
            countryside, are in country districts surrounding large towns and follow a planned route. Most densely
            populated European towns have hiking trails outside them.

        <h2>Running Outdoors</h2>
        <p>For those of you who go running on a treadmill in a gym, running outdoors is quite different. For one thing,
            it is much more stimulating in that the scenery changes. You also get outdoors into the fresh air. If you
            are fortunate enough to live in the countryside, you should appreciate the nature around you. Many people
            find that running outdoors is tougher than running on a running machine. Just stick with it and take it
            slowly. You will find that over time your stamina and pace will improve. Your body will get used to running
            up and down hills. Another advantage of running outdoors is that you can run away from the crowds. You don’t
            have to worry about how others think you look at the gym. If you are out running, you will soon pass by
            anyone who you think may be looking at you. At least you are doing something about caring for yourself.

        <h2>Camping</h2>
        <p>Camping is an outdoor recreational activity where people give up the luxury of a nice warm solid house for a
            flimsy canvas tent to enjoy nature while spending one or more nights at a campsite. They may use a tent, a
            primitive structure, a camping hammock or no shelter at all. Camping is often restricted by law to
            designated sites in order to prevent campers from damaging the environment.

            Camping as a recreational activity became popular in the early 20th century. Campers frequent national
            parks, other publicly owned natural areas, and privately owned campgrounds.

            Camping may be an end unto itself, but often it is done in conjunction with other activities, such as
            hiking, wild swimming, fishing and binge drinking. It may be combined with hiking either as backpacking or
            as a series of day hikes from a central location.

        <h2>Road Biking</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to outdoor activity it is easy to overlook what’s on our own doorstep. But chances are you
            live within a mile or two of the National Cycle Network, making it easy to get on your bike.

            An increasing number of people are beginning to realise the multiple benefits of cycling. It’s obviously
            good for you and good for the environment. And we all know it’s an ideal way to explore the countryside but
            many people overlook the fact that in towns and cities it’s fast – 22 minutes of cycling can take you four
            miles, compared to a journey of 40 minutes by car in a city like London.

            It’s also convenient, it gives you freedom and independence, takes you from door to door, allows you to
            double park, is reliable, and even allows you to make eye contact with fellow human beings. That’s not just
            a win-win situation, it’s a win-win-win-win…

            Imagine what life would be like if people took advantage of these many benefits and chose to travel in ways
            that benefited our health and environment. It’s perhaps a difficult image to conjure up unless you’ve
            visited a pedestrian/cycle friendly city in Europe.

        <h2>Golf</h2>
        <p>
            Which is better? Indoor gaming using virtual reality or playing for real outdoors? Comparing digital golf
            and real golf courses, I look at what they have to offer.

            The imagery in games that are available today is amazing and the movements look so real, almost as if you
            are watching a television show. It’s so easy to just sit there in your virtual world, but what about doing
            the real deal outdoors?

            The games are so intriguing and so well put together and the sound, just fantastic.

            It’s no wonder being sent to your room doesn’t hold as much meaning as it once did. Not just televisions in
            every room but computers, phones, the internet. So what? You’re in your room. Just so happens this is where
            you conduct your business, so you can stay in here all day. Sometimes you do.
            Not hard to waste a day away playing games or keeping in touch with all your friends on Facebook or any
            other social network. You start looking into anything that comes into your mind; it is just a great day in
            age for communication and information being at your fingertips.
